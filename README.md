# mapbox-vue-with-button
This example uses Mapbox GL JS in Vue Framework clustering with HTML markers and the custom property expressions number-format, get, !=, >, >=, all, and case.  You can use HTML or SVG for clusters in place of a Mapbox GL layer by manually synchronizing the clustered source with a pool of marker objects that updates continuously while the map view changes
